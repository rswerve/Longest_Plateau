/* Longest Plateau.  A plateau is a level stretch _above_ the surrounding environment.  
In an array, find the longest run of the same number that is greater than the numbers 
immediately preceding and following it.  For example, 
in the sequence 3-2-2-2-1-3-4-4-1, 2-2-2 is *not* a plateau, because 2 is less than 3.  
4-4 is the longest plateau in that sequence, because 4 is greater than 3 and greater than 1.*/
